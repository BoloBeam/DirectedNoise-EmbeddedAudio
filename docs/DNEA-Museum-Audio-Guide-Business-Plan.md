# DNEA Museum Audio Guide ‚Äî Business Plan & Technical Roadmap

---

## üöÄ Executive Summary

The DNEA Museum Audio Guide leverages Directional Noise-Embedded Audio (DNEA) to deliver personalized, immersive audio experiences in museums‚Äîwithout headphones or disruptive loudspeakers. By creating focused audio zones, DNEA enhances visitor engagement, reduces noise pollution, and addresses hygiene and accessibility concerns. Our phased development plan, starting with a compelling demo and pilot at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum, positions DNEA for rapid validation, market entry, and scalable growth.

## üèÜ Competition Analysis

| Competitor/Product         | Technology         | Strengths                        | Weaknesses/Gap (vs. DNEA)         |
|---------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Parametric Speakers       | Ultrasonic/Parametric | Directional, proven in retail/museums | Expensive, limited masking, less privacy |
| Traditional Audio Guides  | Headphones         | Ubiquitous, easy to deploy       | Hygiene, maintenance, not immersive |
| Open Loudspeakers         | Standard           | Simple, low cost                 | Noise pollution, no personalization |
| DNEA (Proposed)           | Phased Array + Noise Embedding | Personalized, hygienic, immersive, scalable | Early-stage, needs validation      |

**DNEA‚Äôs Edge:** Combines directionality, privacy, and immersive experience with lower maintenance and improved accessibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Feasibility & Components (Phase 1, Weeks 1‚Äì4)

### 1. Hardware Selection & Procurement

- **Speaker Array:**  
  - Linear array, 8‚Äì16 small full-range speakers (e.g., Dayton Audio CE38MB-32)
  - Criteria: 1‚Äì2‚Äù diameter, 200Hz‚Äì10kHz, consistent impedance, cost-effective
  - Order 20‚Äì30 for spares/experimentation

- **Microcontroller:**  
  - ESP32-WROOM-32 (preferred), Arduino Due, or Teensy 4.x
  - Criteria: ‚â•8 PWM channels, ‚â•512KB RAM, ‚â•80MHz, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for future features

- **Amplifier:**  
  - Multi-channel Class-D (e.g., TPA3116D2-based), ‚â•2W/channel, low distortion

- **Power Supply:**  
  - Start with 12V DC wall-wart, later transition to Li-ion battery pack with BMS

- **Enclosure:**  
  - Simple, functional (wood/acrylic/3D-printed), front baffle for speakers, space for electronics

- **Wiring & Misc:**  
  - Speaker wire, jumpers, connectors, breadboard, soldering tools

### 2. Software Development

- **Environment:**  
  - Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (VS Code)

- **Core Features:**  
  - Delay-and-sum beamforming (basic, with adjustable steering)
  - Pink noise generation (PRNG + digital filter)
  - Amplitude modulation for noise embedding
  - Audio playback from flash/SD card
  - Steering control (potentiometer, buttons, or serial interface)
  - Modular code, version control (Git)

### 3. Hardware Assembly & Integration

- **Speaker mounting, wiring, and enclosure assembly**
- **Breadboard prototyping, amplifier/microcontroller integration**
- **Initial system testing (audio playback, beamforming, noise embedding)**

### 4. Demo Testing & Refinement

- **Test in quiet/noisy/simulated museum spaces**
- **Measure SPL, directionality, masking, intelligibility**
- **Iterate on algorithm, hardware, and user experience**
- **Document all results and parameters**
