## Project Overview
Directional Noise-Embedded Audio (DNEA) and Infrasound Technology represent the forefront of acoustic innovation. DNEA enables precise sound targeting in complex environments, while infrasound research explores frequencies below human hearing for applications in health, safety, and communication. This repository consolidates:
- Peer-reviewed research and technical treatises
- Market and impact analyses
- Ethical, legal, and societal implications (ELSI)
- Public awareness and educational resources

**Significance:**
These technologies have transformative potential in:
- Medical therapeutics (e.g., non-invasive neuromodulation, bone conduction for hearing accessibility)
- Security and defense (e.g., crowd control, surveillance)
- Entertainment and immersive experiences
- Environmental monitoring and disaster detection
